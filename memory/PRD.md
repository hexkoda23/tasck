# TASCK OS — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Premium product demo for "TASCK OS" — a creator campaign management platform for the African market. Three versions:
- **V1 (Classic)**: Multi-portal operational platform — COMPLETE
- **V2 (Next)**: AI-native command center — COMPLETE
- **V3 (TASCK v3.2)**: Editorial AI-native platform with Business Case primitive + 4-stage pipeline + live backend — **NOW INCLUDES FULL TTA-USER WORKFLOW** (15 May 2026)

## V3 — v3.2 Architecture

### Business Case Primitive
Every project = one MongoDB document in `v3_business_cases` spanning Connect → Frame → Plan → Deliver → Closure. Single `GET /api/v3/business-cases/:id` returns the full hydrated bundle (brand, creator, alignment_snapshot, brief, snapshot, contract, deliverables, invoices, final_report, brainstorm, interactions, timeline).

### Engagement Tracks
- **Paid**: Strategy Development Fee invoiced on alignment approval.
- **Grant**: SDF waived; TTA absorbs strategy cost; funder pays creator directly.

### Stage Gates (`POST /business-cases/:id/advance`)
- connect → frame: `connect_status === 'qualified_to_frame'`
- frame → plan: alignment approved + scope flags resolved + SDF paid (paid track only)
- plan → deliver: snapshot approved + contract signed
- deliver → closed: closure 100%
- Override via `{override: true, reason: "..."}` for demo flexibility.

### Full Backend API (`/api/v3/*`)
**Read**: `/brands`, `/brands/:id` (hydrated), `/contacts`, `/creators`, `/creators/:id`, `/business-cases`, `/business-cases/:id` (full bundle), `/creative-briefs`, `/creative-snapshots`, `/contracts`, `/deliverables`, `/invoices`, `/final-reports`, `/brainstorm-rounds`, `/interactions`, `/metrics/admin-overview`.

**Write**:
- `POST /brands` — create + auto-create primary contact
- `POST /business-cases` — create in Connect stage
- `POST /business-cases/:id/advance` — gate-checked
- `POST /business-cases/:id/connect/status` — Mark Qualified
- `POST /business-cases/:id/ai/alignment` — generate 11-section template
- `POST /business-cases/:id/ai/alignment/approve` — auto-issues SDF invoice (paid) or waives (grant)
- `POST /business-cases/:id/scope-flags/:idx/resolve`
- `POST /invoices/:id/mark-paid`
- `POST /brainstorm-rounds` — auto-eliminates conversion_behavior < 3
- `POST /creative-briefs` — send brief to creator
- `POST /creative-briefs/:id/simulate-response` — templated AI creator response
- `POST /creative-snapshots` — templated brand-facing snapshot (concept inherits from brief; budget auto-allocated)
- `POST /business-cases/:id/creative-snapshot/approve`
- `POST /contracts` — with AI risk flagging based on template
- `POST /contracts/:id/sign`
- `POST /deliverables` — add milestone
- `POST /deliverables/:id/transition` — 3-stage workflow
- `POST /business-cases/:id/scope-change` — pauses delivery
- `POST /business-cases/:id/scope-change/:id/approve` — resumes
- `POST /business-cases/:id/final-report/generate` — templated from deliverables + snapshot KPIs
- `POST /business-cases/:id/feedback/brand` + `/feedback/creator` — auto-computes score + closure_pct
- `POST /interactions` + `/interactions/ingest-transcript`
- `POST /admin/reset-demo` — wipes and reseeds 14 v3 collections

### Seeded Demo Data
- 11 brands (Coca-Cola, Guinness, MTN, Access, Star Lager (Nigerian Breweries), Pepsi, UBA, Dangote, Airtel, GTBank, **OSF — Grant track**)
- 11 creators (Burna Boy, Tems, Rema, Davido, Ayra Starr, Fireboy, Adekunle Gold, Don Jazzy, Wizkid, Boy Spyce, **C.J. Obasi** for OSF)
- 5 flagship Business Cases (NB Star Originals as primary end-to-end demo; OSF West African Press Freedom as Grant track; Coca-Cola Frame, Guinness Plan, MTN Closure)
- All content realistic TTA-style placeholder (no lorem ipsum)

### V3 Frontend
- 38 existing V3 pages remain functional via `v3data.js` (progressive layering with mock fallback)
- **NEW**: `/v3/admin/business-cases` — list with live metrics, stage/track filters, **+ New Business Case modal**, **Reset demo button**
- **NEW**: `/v3/admin/business-cases/:id` — tabbed live workflow:
  - **Connect**: source/intent display, interactions list, **Log a New Interaction form**, **Mark Qualified button**, Qualify-to-Frame button
  - **Frame**: AI-generated Alignment Snapshot on V3DocumentSurface, **scope-flag Resolve buttons**, SDF invoice (or grant waiver), Advance-to-Plan
  - **Plan**: **PlanStageActions** card surfaces context-aware next CTA (brainstorm → send brief → simulate response → draft snapshot → approve → draft contract → sign), full brainstorm visualisation with auto-eliminated creators
  - **Deliver**: milestone tracker, **Add deliverable button**, 3-stage transition, scope-change request/approve, scope-creep pause banner
  - **Closure**: **Generate Final Report button**, KPI variance table, closure checklist, brand/creator feedback forms
- **Upgraded** `/v3/admin/crm`: live brands list with Paid/Grant pills + **Add Brand modal**

### Testing
- iteration_12.json — backend read flows + new admin pages: 100% (16/16 + 4/4)
- **iteration_13.json — backend write flows + full TTA-user UI walkthrough: 100% (11/11 backend + all UI flows)**

### Demo Reset
Click the Reset demo button on `/v3/admin/business-cases` (or POST `/api/v3/admin/reset-demo`). Restores the 5 seeded Business Cases. Use between MI rehearsal runs.

### Remaining P2 / Future
- Wire Brand + Creator portals to `/api/v3/*` (still on `v3data.js` fallback)
- Resolve low-priority React hydration console warning from visual-editor `<span>` inside `<select>` on the New BC modal
- Real LLM integration for AI moments (currently deterministic templates per user choice)
- Mobile responsiveness pass
- WhatsApp integration
